## Version

Current release: `v1.0.0`.

## Deployment

Published on Netlify at https://1asi0730-2620-8084-codecrafters.netlify.app/ from the `main` branch. Netlify publishes a new version after every integration into `main`.

The calls to action of each target segment point to the web application deployed on Vercel at https://frontend-web-aplication.vercel.app: logistics supervisors go to `/monitoring`, corner stores and minimarkets to `/tracking` and distribution managers to `/analytics`.

## Conventions

- **GitFlow**: `main` holds released versions, `develop` integrates work, and every feature lives in its own `feature/<kebab-case-name>` branch.
- **Conventional Commits** for every commit message.
- **Semantic Versioning** for every release, tagged from a `release/<version>` branch.
